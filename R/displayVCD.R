# code for diplaying/plotting here

# when summing up toggles for displaying a higher level value, we could paralllelize over the submodules of the selected module, see data.tree examples for that
# put the counting code into a separate .R file

# displaying arguments: top module, (depth to prepare),depth to display=0, weights=c(toX=1,to1=1,..), timerange=c(start,stop)
# select colors from RColorBrewer
# make plots interactive: clicking on a signal zooms in, if detail level is prepared
