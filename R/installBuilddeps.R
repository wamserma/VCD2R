# Install dependencies needed for building the Package

# This would be nicer as Rmd file, but we load knitr in this file the first time

## per http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/intro.html

#```{r}
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr"))
#```

## for Package Code
#```{r}
  # none
#```
